<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>PETER PAN & WENDY</h3>
<p>Peter Pan & Wendy's obligatory fidelity to the animated classic keeps it from achieving Neverland nirvana, but David Lowery's pensive direction gives this rendition some of its own magic.</p>
<h3>GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY</h3>
<p>A galactic group hug that might squeeze a little too tight on the heartstrings, the final Guardians of the Galaxy is a loving last hurrah for the MCU's most ragtag family.</p>
<h3>DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: HONOR AMONG THIEVES</h3>
<p>An infectiously good-spirited comedy with a solid emotional core, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves offers fun fantasy and adventure even if you don't know your HP from your OP.</p>
